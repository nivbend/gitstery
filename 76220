the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager. As I passed the tall man
who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, "Walk past me,
and then look back at me." The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down. They could
only have come from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very
wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees, as though it had
dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all
my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment. He had turned his back
so that none could see him but I. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had
regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise, was none other than

half round to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped senility.

"Holmes!" I whispered, "what on earth are you doing in this den?"
