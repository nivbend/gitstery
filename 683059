"I will go when I have said my say. Don't you dare to meddle with my affairs. I know that Miss
Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a dangerous man to fall foul of! See here." He stepped
swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.

"See that you keep yourself out of my grip," he snarled, and hurling the twisted poker into the
fireplace he strode out of the room.

"He seems a very amiable person," said Holmes, laughing. "I am not quite so bulky, but if he had
remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own." As he spoke he
picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.

"Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force! This incident
gives zest to our investigation, however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer
from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson, we shall order breakfast,
and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors' Commons, where I hope to get some data which may help
us in this matter."
