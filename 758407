"Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, however,
was out of the question. The man's business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house
which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at. It
must, then, be something out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant's fondness
for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this
tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal
with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the cellar--
something which took many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once more? I could think
of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building.

"So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I surprised you by beating upon the
pavement with my stick. I was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It
was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had some
skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees
were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they
were. They spoke of those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing
for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our friend's premises, and
felt that I had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard
and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen."
