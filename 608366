I groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.

We heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon the linoleum. Our own door
flew open, and a lady, clad in some dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.

"You will excuse my calling so late," she began, and then, suddenly losing her self-control, she ran
forward, threw her arms about my wife's neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. "Oh, I'm in such
trouble!" she cried; "I do so want a little help."

"Why," said my wife, pulling up her veil, "it is Kate Whitney.  How you startled me, Kate! I had not
an idea who you were when you came in."

"I didn't know what to do, so I came straight to you." That was always the way. Folk who were in
grief came to my wife like birds to a light-house.
