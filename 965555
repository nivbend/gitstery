"It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy
concealment about a woman's dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and

Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over
to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or
political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she had
resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be in
her own house."

"But it has twice been burgled."

"Pshaw! They did not know how to look."
