"And what then?"

"You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur. There is only one point on
which I must insist. You must not interfere, come what may. You understand?"

"I am to be neutral?"

"To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It
will end in my being conveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room
window will open. You are to station yourself close to that open window."

"Yes."

"You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you."
