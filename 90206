"You have it, sir, just as it happened."

"I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller," said Holmes, "for you have certainly cleared up
everything which puzzled us. And here comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think,
Watson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our locus
standi now is rather a questionable one."

And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door.
Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his
devoted wife. They still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of Rucastle's past
life that he finds it difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by
special license, in Southampton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a government
appointment in the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my
disappointment, manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of
one of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at Walsall, where I believe that
she has met with considerable success.
