"The police have watched this Lascar," said Inspector Bradstreet, "and I can quite understand that
he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor
customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days."

"That was it," said Holmes, nodding approvingly; "I have no doubt of it. But have you never been
prosecuted for begging?"

"Many times; but what was a fine to me?"

"It must stop here, however," said Bradstreet. "If the police are to hush this thing up, there must
be no more of Hugh Boone."
