"'I say a night's work, but an hour's would be nearer the mark. I simply want your opinion about a
hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set

"'The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.'

"'Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last train.'

"'Where to?'

"'To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders of Oxfordshire, and within seven
miles of Reading. There is a train from Paddington which would bring you there at about 11.15.'

"'Very good.'
