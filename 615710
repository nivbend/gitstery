Lestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his forehead three times, shook
his head solemnly, and hurried away.

He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his overcoat. "There is something
in what the fellow says about outdoor work," he remarked, "so I think, Watson, that I must leave you
to your papers for a little."

It was after five o'clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no time to be lonely, for within
an hour there arrived a confectioner's man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked with the
help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite
epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany. There were
a couple of brace of cold woodcock, a pheasant, a pâté de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and
cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my two visitors vanished away, like the genii
of the Arabian Nights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered
to this address.
