Holmes shook his head gravely. "It would cease to be a danger if we could define it," said he. "But
at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring me down to your help."

"That is enough." She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face. "I shall
go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my
poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow." With a few grateful words to Holmes she
bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her way.

"At least," said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the stairs, "she seems to be a young
lady who is very well able to take care of herself."

"And she would need to be," said Holmes gravely. "I am much mistaken if we do not hear from her
before many days are past."

It was not very long before my friend's prediction was fulfilled. A fortnight went by, during which
I frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of
human experience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual salary, the curious conditions, the
light duties, all pointed to something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man
were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to determine. As to Holmes, I
observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air,
but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it. "Data! data! data!" he
cried impatiently. "I can't make bricks without clay." And yet he would always wind up by muttering
that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation.
