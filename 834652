"What is the name of this obliging youth?" asked Sherlock Holmes.

"His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he's not such a youth, either. It's hard to say his age. I
should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better himself

ideas in his head?"

"Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employee who comes under the full market price.
It is not a common experience among employers in this age. I don't know that your assistant is not
as remarkable as your advertisement."

"Oh, he has his faults, too," said Mr. Wilson. "Never was such a fellow for photography. Snapping
away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like
a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his main fault, but on the whole he's a good
worker. There's no vice in him."
