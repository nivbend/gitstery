"Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it?" He opened his bag as he
spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a
bride's wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. "There," said he, putting a new
wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. "There is a little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes."

"Oh, indeed!" said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air.  "You dragged them from the
Serpentine?"

"No. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. They have been identified as her
clothes, and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off."

"By the same brilliant reasoning, every man's body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his
wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive at through this?"

"At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance."
