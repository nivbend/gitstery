"One day--it was in March, 1883--a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the
colonel's plate. It was not a common thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid
in ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. 'From India!' said he as he took it up,
'Pondicherry postmark! What can this be?' Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little dried
orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck
from my lips at the sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his skin the
colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand, 'K. K.
K.!' he shrieked, and then, 'My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!'

"'What is it, uncle?' I cried.

"'Death,' said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room, leaving me palpitating with
horror. I took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum,
the letter K three times repeated. There was nothing else save the five dried pips. What could be
the reason of his overpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I ascended the stair I met
him coming down with an old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a
small brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.
