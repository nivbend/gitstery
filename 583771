"It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror." She raised her veil as she spoke, and we could see that she
was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened
eyes, like those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but
her hair was shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard. Sherlock Holmes ran
her over with one of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.

"You must not fear," said he soothingly, bending forward and patting her forearm. "We shall soon set
matters right, I have no doubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see."

"You know me, then?"

"No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove. You must have
started early, and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the
station."
