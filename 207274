"Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer Angel must have some strong
object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by
the incident, as far as we could see, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never
together, but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were the
tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers.
My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature, which, of
course, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the
smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones, all pointed
in the same direction."

"And how did you verify them?"

"Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew the firm for which this man
worked. Having taken the printed description, I eliminated everything from it which could be the
result of a disguise--the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a
request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers.
I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his
business address asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his reply was typewritten and
revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from
Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description tallied in every respect with
that of their employee, James Windibank. Voilà tout!"

"And Miss Sutherland?"

"If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old Persian saying, 'There is danger
for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.' There
is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world."
