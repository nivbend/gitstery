"It means that it is all over," Holmes answered. "And perhaps, after all, it is for the best. Take
your pistol, and we will enter Dr. Roylott's room."

With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor. Twice he struck at the chamber
door without any reply from within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the
cocked pistol in my hand.

It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half
open, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this
table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare
ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap
lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin was cocked
upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling. Round his
brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round
his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.

"The band! the speckled band!" whispered Holmes.
