The man burst into a hearty laugh. "They might be useful to me as relics of my adventure," said he,
"but beyond that I can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to
be to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my attentions to the excellent
bird which I perceive upon the sideboard."

Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders.

"There is your hat, then, and there your bird," said he. "By the way, would it bore you to tell me
where you got the other one from? I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better
grown goose."

"Certainly, sir," said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm.
"There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum--we are to be found in the Museum
itself during the day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name, instituted a
goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to receive a bird
at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you,
sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity." With a comical pomposity of
manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way.
