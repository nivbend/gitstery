My friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressing-
gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day
before still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down the centre of
Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and
on the heaped-up edges of the foot-paths it still lay as white as when it fell. The grey pavement
had been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer
passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save
the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.

He was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a massive, strongly marked face and a
commanding figure. He was dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat
brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the
dignity of his dress and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little springs, such as
a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his
hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions.

"What on earth can be the matter with him?" I asked. "He is looking up at the numbers of the
houses."

"I believe that he is coming here," said Holmes, rubbing his hands.

"Here?"
