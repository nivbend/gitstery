"It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the return to Hatherley Farm. On
the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not
surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. This observation of his had the
natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the
coroner's jury."

"It was a confession," I ejaculated.

"No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence."

"Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least a most suspicious remark."

"On the contrary," said Holmes, "it is the brightest rift which I can at present see in the clouds.
However innocent he might be, he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the
circumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or feigned
indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger
would not be natural under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to a
scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man, or else as
a man of considerable self-restraint and firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also
not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father, and that there is no
doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and
even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise his hand as if to strike
him. The self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs
of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one."

I shook my head. "Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence," I remarked.
