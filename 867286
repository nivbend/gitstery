"And your mother is alive?"

"Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn't best pleased, Mr. Holmes, when she married again so
soon after father's death, and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a
plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on
with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he was
very superior, being a traveller in wines. They got £4700 for the goodwill and interest, which
wasn't near as much as father could have got if he had been alive."

I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative,
but, on the contrary, he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.

"Your own little income," he asked, "does it come out of the business?"
