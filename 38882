"But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room. Would the body be dressed in a
coat alone?"

"No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that this man Boone had thrust
Neville St. Clair through the window, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed. What
would he do then? It would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell-tale
garments. He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it would occur
to him that it would swim and not sink. He has little time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs
when the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his Lascar
confederate that the police are hurrying up the street. There is not an instant to be lost. He
rushes to some secret hoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all
the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coat's sinking. He
throws it out, and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of
steps below, and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared."

"It certainly sounds feasible."
