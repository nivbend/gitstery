We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning. Our
cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow
passage and through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small corridor, which
ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone
steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and
then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a
huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.

"You are not very vulnerable from above," Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about
him.
