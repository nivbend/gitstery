"What is the name of this obliging youth?" asked Sherlock Holmes.

"His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he's not such a youth, either. It's hard to say his age. I
should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better himself
and earn twice what I am able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put
ideas in his head?"

"Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employee who comes under the full market price.
It is not a common experience among employers in this age. I don't know that your assistant is not
as remarkable as your advertisement."

"Oh, he has his faults, too," said Mr. Wilson. "Never was such a fellow for photography. Snapping
away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like
a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his main fault, but on the whole he's a good
worker. There's no vice in him."

"He is still with you, I presume?"

"Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean--
that's all I have in the house, for I am a widower and never had any family. We live very quietly,
sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.
