"A day which has saved England from a great public scandal," said the banker, rising. "Sir, I cannot
find words to thank you, but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your skill has
indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him
for the wrong which I have done him. As to what you tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my very heart.
Not even your skill can inform me where she is now."

"I think that we may safely say," returned Holmes, "that she is wherever Sir George Burnwell is. It
is equally certain, too, that whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient
punishment."
