"It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and water, and sit here comfortably
and tell us all about it. Or should you rather that I sent James off to bed?"

It was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband's trouble, to me as a doctor, to
my wife as an old friend and school companion. We soothed and comforted her by such words as we
could find. Did she know where her husband was? Was it possible that we could bring him back to her?
