"Just one hint to you, Lestrade," drawled Holmes before his rival vanished; "I will tell you the
true solution of the matter. Lady St. Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any
such person."

Lestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his forehead three times, shook
his head solemnly, and hurried away.

He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his overcoat. "There is something
in what the fellow says about outdoor work," he remarked, "so I think, Watson, that I must leave you
to your papers for a little."
