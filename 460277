"No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we wanted for ourselves."

"Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You will excuse me for a few

in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks between the
boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he
walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the
wall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.

"Why, it's a dummy," said he.

"Won't it ring?"

"No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You can see now that it is
fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is."

"How very absurd! I never noticed that before."
