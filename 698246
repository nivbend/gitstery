"Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet," cried the little fellow with
outstretched hands and quivering fingers. "I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this
matter."

Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. "In that case we had better discuss it in a
cosy room rather than in this wind-swept market-place," said he. "But pray tell me, before we go
farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting."

The man hesitated for an instant. "My name is John Robinson," he answered with a sidelong glance.

"No, no; the real name," said Holmes sweetly. "It is always awkward doing business with an alias."

A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. "Well then," said he, "my real name is James
Ryder."

"Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step into the cab, and I shall soon be
able to tell you everything which you would wish to know."
