"Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points. One is that the murdered man
had an appointment with someone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for
his son was away, and he did not know when he would return. The second is that the murdered man was
heard to cry 'Cooee!' before he knew that his son had returned. Those are the crucial points upon
which the case depends. And now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave
all minor matters until to-morrow."

There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and cloudless. At nine
o'clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe
Pool.

"There is serious news this morning," Lestrade observed. "It is said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall,
is so ill that his life is despaired of."

"An elderly man, I presume?" said Holmes.
