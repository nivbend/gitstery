"It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory. The
manor-house is, as I have already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The bedrooms
in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings.
Of these bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott's, the second my sister's, and the third my own. There is
no communication between them, but they all open out into the same corridor. Do I make myself
plain?"

"Perfectly so."
