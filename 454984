"No crime, but a very great error has been committed," said Holmes. "You would have done better to
have trusted your wife."

"It was not the wife; it was the children," groaned the prisoner. "God help me, I would not have
them ashamed of their father. My God! What an exposure! What can I do?"

Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder.

"If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up," said he, "of course you can hardly avoid
publicity. On the other hand, if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case
against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the
papers. Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you might tell us and
submit it to the proper authorities. The case would then never go into court at all."
