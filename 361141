"In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no actual ill-treatment from Mr.
and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and I am not
easy in my mind about them."

"What can you not understand?"

"Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as it occurred. When I came down,
Mr. Rucastle met me here and drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said,
beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square block of a house,
whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds round it,
woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton highroad, which
curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. This ground in front belongs to the house,
but the woods all round are part of Lord Southerton's preserves. A clump of copper beeches
immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place.
