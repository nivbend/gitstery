At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet returned. The landlady
informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning. I sat down beside
the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already
deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange
features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature
of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from
the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly
grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his
system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most
inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of
his failing had ceased to enter into my head.

It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-
whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was
to my friend's amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was
certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five
minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched
out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.

"Well, really!" he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back,
limp and helpless, in the chair.
