"My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas
present, and I knew that she was always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I
would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this I drove one of
the birds--a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill open, I
thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt
the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature flapped and struggled, and
out came my sister to know what was the matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose
and fluttered off among the others.

"'Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?' says she.

"'Well,' said I, 'you said you'd give me one for Christmas, and I was feeling which was the
fattest.'

"'Oh,' says she, 'we've set yours aside for you--Jem's bird, we call it. It's the big white one over
yonder. There's twenty-six of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the
market.'

"'Thank you, Maggie,' says I; 'but if it is all the same to you, I'd rather have that one I was
handling just now.'
