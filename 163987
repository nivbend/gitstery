"You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go to the prison to see James.
Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that I know him to be innocent."

"I will, Miss Turner."

"I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I leave him. Good-bye, and God help
you in your undertaking." She hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard
the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.

"I am ashamed of you, Holmes," said Lestrade with dignity after a few minutes' silence. "Why should
you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it
cruel."

"I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy," said Holmes. "Have you an order to see him
in prison?"

"Yes, but only for you and me."
