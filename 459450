"Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points on which I must confess that

"I will soon make it clear to you," said she; "and I'd have done so before now if I could ha' got

that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice's friend too.

"She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn't, from the time that her father married again. She
was slighted like and had no say in anything, but it never really became bad for her until after she
met Mr. Fowler at a friend's house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by
will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them but just left
everything in Mr. Rucastle's hands. He knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a
husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give him, then her father thought
it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he
could use her money. When she wouldn't do it, he kept on worrying her until she got brain-fever, and
for six weeks was at death's door. Then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her
beautiful hair cut off; but that didn't make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as true
as man could be."
