He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that I
have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks,
all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.

"Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!" she cried, glancing from one to the other of us, and finally, with a
woman's quick intuition, fastening upon my companion, "I am so glad that you have come. I have
driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn't do it. I know it, and I want you to start upon
your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each other since
we were little children, and I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to
hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him."
