"I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor," said he, "but I have had a very serious accident
during the night. I came in by train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I
might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a card, but I see
that she has left it upon the side-table."

I took it up and glanced at it. "Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd
floor)." That was the name, style, and abode of my morning visitor. "I regret that I have kept you
waiting," said I, sitting down in my library-chair. "You are fresh from a night journey, I
understand, which is in itself a monotonous occupation."

"Oh, my night could not be called monotonous," said he, and laughed. He laughed very heartily, with
a high, ringing note, leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. All my medical instincts rose
up against that laugh.

"Stop it!" I cried; "pull yourself together!" and I poured out some water from a caraffe.

It was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong
nature when some great crisis is over and gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very weary
and pale-looking.
