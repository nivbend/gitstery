"I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I soon had a pretty good plan
of the whole house in my head. There was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at
all. A door which faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite, but
it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out
through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very different
person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his brow was all
crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and
hurried past me without a word or a look.

"This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge, I strolled
round to the side from which I could see the windows of this part of the house. There were four of
them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up. They were
evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle came
out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.

"'Ah!' said he, 'you must not think me rude if I passed you without a word, my dear young lady. I
was preoccupied with business matters.'

"I assured him that I was not offended. 'By the way,' said I, 'you seem to have quite a suite of
spare rooms up there, and one of them has the shutters up.'

"He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my remark.

"'Photography is one of my hobbies,' said he. 'I have made my dark room up there. But, dear me! what
an observant young lady we have come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever believed
it?' He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me. I read
suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.
