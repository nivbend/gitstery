Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow [it said]. Do come! I am at my
wit's end. Hunter.

"Will you come with me?" asked Holmes, glancing up.

"I should wish to."

"Just look it up, then."

"There is a train at half-past nine," said I, glancing over my Bradshaw. "It is due at Winchester at
11.30."
