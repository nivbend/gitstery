"Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What d'you want to frighten a chap for?"
He sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key.

"I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two days for you. You should be
ashamed of yourself!"

"So I am. But you've got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few hours, three pipes, four
pipes--I forget how many. But I'll go home with you. I wouldn't frighten Kate--poor little Kate.
Give me your hand! Have you a cab?"

"Yes, I have one waiting."

"Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe, Watson. I am all off colour. I
can do nothing for myself."

I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers, holding my breath to keep out
the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager. As I passed the tall man
who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, "Walk past me,
and then look back at me." The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down. They could
only have come from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very
wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees, as though it had
dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all
my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment. He had turned his back
so that none could see him but I. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had
regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise, was none other than
Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face
half round to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped senility.
