"You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his
house?"

"One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no less than five, I think that
there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning
tallow--walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the
other. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?"

"Well, it is very ingenious," said I, laughing; "but since, as you said just now, there has been no
crime committed, and no harm done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of
energy."

Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open, and Peterson, the
commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed
with astonishment.

"The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!" he gasped.
