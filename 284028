"Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in which you were interested--white,
with a black bar across the tail."

Ryder quivered with emotion. "Oh, sir," he cried, "can you tell me where it went to?"

"It came here."

"Here?"

"Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don't wonder that you should take an interest in it.
It laid an egg after it was dead--the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have
it here in my museum."

Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand. Holmes unlocked
his strong-box and held up the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant,
many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to
disown it.
