"'Come! come!' she cried breathlessly. 'They will be here in a moment. They will see that you are
not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious time, but come!'

"This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my feet and ran with her along the
corridor and down a winding stair. The latter led to another broad passage, and just as we reached
it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering the other from
the floor on which  we were and from the one beneath. My guide stopped and looked about her like one
who is at her wit's end. Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window of

and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty

back.

"'Fritz! Fritz!' she cried in English, 'remember your promise after the last time. You said it
should not be again. He will be silent! Oh, he will be silent!'
