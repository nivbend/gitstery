crop from the rack. "Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to

"We're hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see," said Jones in his consequential way. "Our friend
here is a wonderful man for starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the
running down."
