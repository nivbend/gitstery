"You must not fear," said he soothingly, bending forward and patting her forearm. "We shall soon set
matters right, I have no doubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see."

"You know me, then?"

"No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove. You must have
started early, and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the
station."

The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion.

"There is no mystery, my dear madam," said he, smiling. "The left arm of your jacket is spattered
with mud in no less than seven places. The marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a
dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the
driver."

"Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct," said she. "I started from home before
six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can
stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to--none, save
only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you, Mr.
Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It
was from her that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and at
least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my
power to reward you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married, with the
control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful."
