"What is it?"

"It's quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended by
doing."

"I can't imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss
Irene Adler."

"Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however. I left the house a little
after eight o'clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful
sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to
know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in
front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on the right
side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those preposterous English window
fasteners which a child could open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage
window could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and examined it closely
from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest.

"I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs
down by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received
in exchange twopence, a glass of half and half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information
as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood
in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to."

"And what of Irene Adler?" I asked.
