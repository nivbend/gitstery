"You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl, Miss
Hunter. Do you think that you could perform one more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not

"We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o'clock, my friend and I. The Rucastles will be gone by
that time, and Toller will, we hope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give
the alarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the key upon her, you
would facilitate matters immensely."
