"I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise,
though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no
one to advise her at such a crisis."

"It was a slight, sir, a public slight," said Lord St. Simon, tapping his fingers upon the table.

"You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented a position."

"I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been shamefully used."

"I think that I heard a ring," said Holmes. "Yes, there are steps on the landing. If I cannot
persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here
who may be more successful." He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman. "Lord St.
Simon," said he "allow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I think,
you have already met."

At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect, with his
eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity.
The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he still refused to
raise his eyes. It was as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was one which it
was hard to resist.
