"I only looked in as I passed," said he. "I am going right on."

"Where to?"

"Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time before I get back. Don't wait up for me
in case I should be late."

"How are you getting on?"

"Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since I saw you last, but I did not
call at the house. It is a very sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a good
deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable clothes off and return
to my highly respectable self."

I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would
imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened
upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that he was off
once more upon his congenial hunt.
