A flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face, and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket. "I
met him first at the gasfitters' ball," she said. "They used to send father tickets when he was
alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish
us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join
a Sunday-school treat. But this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to
prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all father's friends were to be there.
And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as
taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to France upon the
business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it
was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel."

"I suppose," said Holmes, "that when Mr. Windibank came back from France he was very annoyed at your
having gone to the ball."

"Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and shrugged his shoulders, and said
there was no use denying anything to a woman, for she would have her way."
