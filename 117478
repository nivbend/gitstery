"Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does not seem to be any very pressing
need for repairs at that end wall."

"There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room."

"Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which
these three rooms open. There are windows in it, of course?"

"Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through."

"As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable from that side. Now, would
you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters?"

Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the open window, endeavoured in
every way to force the shutter open, but without success. There was no slit through which a knife
could be passed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid
iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. "Hum!" said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity,
"my theory certainly presents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they were
bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter."
