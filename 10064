"I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if I wanted your
help. I should feel so much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me."

"Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that your little problem promises to be
the most interesting which has come my way for some months. There is something distinctly novel
about some of the features. If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger--"

"Danger! What danger do you foresee?"

Holmes shook his head gravely. "It would cease to be a danger if we could define it," said he. "But
at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring me down to your help."

"That is enough." She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face. "I shall
go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my
poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow." With a few grateful words to Holmes she
bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her way.

"At least," said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the stairs, "she seems to be a young
lady who is very well able to take care of herself."
