"Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the Friday. Was it to be in church?"

"Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour's, near King's Cross, and we were to have
breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two
of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which happened to be the only
other cab in the street. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited
for him to step out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there
was no one there! The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen
him get in with his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard
anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him."
