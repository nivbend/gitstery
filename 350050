"'My dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes: "'Lord Backwater tells me that I may place implicit reliance upon
your judgment and discretion. I have determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in
reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade,
of Scotland Yard, is acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no objection to
your co-operation, and that he even thinks that it might be of some assistance. I will call at four
o'clock in the afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that time, I hope that you
will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount importance. "'Yours faithfully, "'St. Simon.'

"It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the noble lord has had the
misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger," remarked Holmes as
he folded up the epistle.

"He says four o'clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour."

"Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the subject. Turn over those papers
and arrange the extracts in their order of time, while I take a glance as to who our client is." He
picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece. "Here he is,"
said he, sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee. "'Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St.
Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral.' Hum! 'Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess
sable. Born in 1846.' He's forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. Was Under-Secretary
for the colonies in a late administration. The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for
Foreign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and Tudor on the distaff side.
Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive in all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for
something more solid."
