"Where, then, is my wife?"

"That is a detail which I shall speedily supply."

Lord St. Simon shook his head. "I am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine," he
remarked, and bowing in a stately, old-fashioned manner he departed.

"It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own," said
Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "I think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this
cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room."

"My dear Holmes!"

"I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked before, which were quite as
prompt. My whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence
is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau's example."
