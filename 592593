"I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands," remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs
clattered upon his wrists. "You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the
goodness, also, when you address me always to say 'sir' and 'please.'"

"All right," said Jones with a stare and a snigger. "Well, would you please, sir, march upstairs,
where we can get a cab to carry your Highness to the police-station?"

"That is better," said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked
quietly off in the custody of the detective.

"Really, Mr. Holmes," said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from the cellar, "I do not know how
the bank can thank you or repay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the
most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within
my experience."
