"Her father is very rich?"

"He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope."

"And how did he make his money?"

"In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold, invested it, and came up by leaps
and bounds."

"Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady's--your wife's character?"

The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire. "You see, Mr. Holmes,"
said he, "my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man. During that time she ran free in a
mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come from Nature
rather than from the schoolmaster. She is what we call in England a tomboy, with a strong nature,
wild and free, unfettered by any sort of traditions. She is impetuous--volcanic, I was about to say.
She is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions. On the other hand,
I would not have given her the name which I have the honour to bear"--he gave a little stately
cough--"had not I thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is capable of heroic
self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her."
