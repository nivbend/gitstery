The Red-headed League          is       Dissolved   October 9, 1890.

Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the
comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out
into a roar of laughter.

"I cannot see that there is anything very funny," cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his
flaming head. "If you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere."

"No, no," cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen. "I really
wouldn't miss your case for the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will
excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when you
found the card upon the door?"

"I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the offices round, but none of
them seemed to know anything about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living
on the ground-floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League.
He said that he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He
answered that the name was new to him.

"'Well,' said I, 'the gentleman at No. 4.'
