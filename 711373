Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am a practical man," he said, "and I really cannot undertake to
go about the country looking for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the
laughing-stock of Scotland Yard."

"All right," said Holmes quietly. "I have given you the chance. Here are your lodgings. Good-bye. I
shall drop you a line before I leave."

Having left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we found lunch upon the table.
Holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds
himself in a perplexing position.
