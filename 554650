"Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor," murmured Holmes without opening his eyes. For many years
he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was
difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In this
case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-
commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.
