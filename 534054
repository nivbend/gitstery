Nobody's home. From the stack of letters in the mailbox nobody's been here for a good few days.

Without a warrant you can't get into the house, but you can still checkout the area. Maybe talk with
some of the neighbors.

The guy next door says he barely ever spoke to the suspect, "was a bit of a loner" is what he says.
Doesn't know what type of vehicle he drives.

You take a stroll around the house, there's a back porch that probably seen better days. You spot a
driveway next to it leading to a garage. The door's open and you see a green Hyundai parked there.
