"To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You may know the
strict principles of her family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to
my conduct would bring the matter to an end."

"And Irene Adler?"

"Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that she will do it. You do not
know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind
of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which
she would not go--none."

"You are sure that she has not sent it yet?"

"I am sure."
