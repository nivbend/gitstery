"'Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,' he answered, turning away from me with a sneer. I
saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I
called in the inspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once not only of his person
but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems;
but no trace of them could be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our
persuasions and our threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after going through all
the police formalities, have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling
the matter. The police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it. You may go
to any expense which you think necessary. I have already offered a reward of £1000. My God, what
shall I do! I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!"

He put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro, droning to himself like a
child whose grief has got beyond words.

Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the
fire.

"Do you receive much company?" he asked.

"None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of Arthur's. Sir George Burnwell has
been several times lately. No one else, I think."
