"Not at all. Drink this." I dashed some brandy into the water, and the colour began to come back to
his bloodless cheeks.

"That's better!" said he. "And now, Doctor, perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb, or rather
to the place where my thumb used to be."

He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look
at it. There were four protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should
have been. It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots.

"Good heavens!" I cried, "this is a terrible injury. It must have bled considerably."

"Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have been senseless for a long
time. When I came to I found that it was still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very
tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig."
