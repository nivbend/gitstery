How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his
senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very
plain tale. He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet
and the other unusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman,
being less bold or less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious
man out of the way of danger.

"Well," said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to London, "it has been
a pretty business for me! I have lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I
gained?"
