Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. "Shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they
once were," he remarked. "I had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off
both my hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering
them."

"Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat it."

"To eat it!" Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.

"Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so. But I presume that this other goose
upon the sideboard, which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose
equally well?"
