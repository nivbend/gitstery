"Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever seen that her temper was just a

seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause."

"Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the general public were present,
then?"

"Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open."
