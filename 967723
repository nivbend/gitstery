"But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?" I asked.

"Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here. Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put
two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my
friend and colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have no news of her husband. Here we are.
Whoa, there, whoa!"

We had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds. A stable-boy had run
out to the horse's head, and springing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive
which led to the house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the
opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her
neck and wrists. She stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the
door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with
eager eyes and parted lips, a standing question.
