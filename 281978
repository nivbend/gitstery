"Then I can wait in the next room."

"Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper in many of my most
successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also."

The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick little
questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes.

"Try the settee," said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together, as
was his custom when in judicial moods. "I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that
is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have shown your
relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my
saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures."

"Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me," I observed.

"You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went into the very simple problem
presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must
go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination."
