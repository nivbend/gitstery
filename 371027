"There is serious news this morning," Lestrade observed. "It is said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall,
is so ill that his life is despaired of."

"An elderly man, I presume?" said Holmes.

"About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad, and he has been in failing
health for some time. This business has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of
McCarthy's, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley
Farm rent free."
