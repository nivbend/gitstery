"Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say, Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back
and leave it here with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which
your family is now devouring."

When the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it against the light. "It's a
bonny thing," said he. "Just see how it glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of
crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil's pet baits. In the larger and older jewels every
facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found in the banks
of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the
carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has already
a sinister history. There have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several
robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal. Who would
think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison? I'll lock it up in my
strong box now and drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it."
