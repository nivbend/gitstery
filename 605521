by the study of the parents. Don't you see that the converse is equally valid. I have frequently
gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children. This child's
disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty's sake, and whether he derives this from his
smiling father, as I should suspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in
their power."
