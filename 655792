"Now, Mr. Holder," said Holmes, "here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so
unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will break it off."

The banker recoiled in horror. "I should not dream of trying," said he.

"Then I will." Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without result. "I feel it give a
little," said he; "but, though I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my
time to break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would happen if I did
break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this
happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?"

"I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me."
