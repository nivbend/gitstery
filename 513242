your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it, went off to some
other place, concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them,
and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to the
greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?"

innocent, why does he not explain them?"
