"Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but, between ourselves, if it were not
for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my
statement, for it is a very extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof with which to
back it up; and, even if they believe me, the clues which I can give them are so vague that it is a
question whether justice will be done."

"Ha!" cried I, "if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved, I
should strongly recommend you to come to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the
official police."

"Oh, I have heard of that fellow," answered my visitor, "and I should be very glad if he would take
the matter up, though of course I must use the official police as well. Would you give me an
introduction to him?"

"I'll do better. I'll take you round to him myself."

"I should be immensely obliged to you."
