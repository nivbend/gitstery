"You reasoned it out beautifully," I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration. "It is so long a chain, and
yet every link rings true."

"It saved me from ennui," he answered, yawning. "Alas! I already feel it closing in upon me. My life
is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help
me to do so."

"And you are a benefactor of the race," said I.

He shrugged his shoulders. "Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use," he remarked.
"'L'homme c'est rien--l'oeuvre c'est tout,' as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand."

"My dear fellow," said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker
Street, "life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We would not
dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of
that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the
queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the
wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most outré results, it
would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and
unprofitable."
