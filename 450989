What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it
appeared to me that the night must have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were
weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest
pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my
companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin,
sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look over the case in the direction of
the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.

At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it lengthened out until it became a
yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a
white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area of light. For a minute
or more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as
suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink
between the stones.
