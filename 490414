"It's a new patient," he whispered. "I thought I'd bring him round myself; then he couldn't slip
away. There he is, all safe and sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as
you." And off he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.

I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table. He was quietly dressed in a
suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of his
hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains. He was young, not
more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale
and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all
his strength of mind to control.
