The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty
and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the advertisement
column, with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look
at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indications which might
be presented by his dress or appearance.

I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore every mark of being an average
commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd's check
trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a
heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed
top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him.
Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head,
and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.

Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed
my questioning glances. "Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that
he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a
considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else."

Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my
companion.
