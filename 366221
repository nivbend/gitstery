"I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From north, south, east, and west every
man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet
Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope's Court looked like a coster's orange barrow. I
should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that
single advertisement. Every shade of colour they were--straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter,
liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint.
When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear
of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me
through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon
the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we
could and soon found ourselves in the office."

"Your experience has been a most entertaining one," remarked Holmes as his client paused and
refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff. "Pray continue your very interesting statement."
