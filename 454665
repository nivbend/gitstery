should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home. In that,
however, I was in error. Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram from the major,
imploring me to come at once. My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in
the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I hurried to him, but he passed
away without having ever recovered his consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from
Fareham in the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury
had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of 'death from accidental causes.' Carefully as I
examined every fact connected with his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the
idea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no robbery, no record of strangers
having been seen upon the roads. And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and
that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.
