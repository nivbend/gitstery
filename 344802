"Holmes!" I whispered, "what on earth are you doing in this den?"

"As low as you can," he answered; "I have excellent ears. If you would have the great kindness to
get rid of that sottish friend of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with
you."

"I have a cab outside."

"Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he appears to be too limp to get into
any mischief. I should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you
have thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait outside, I shall be with you in five minutes."

"I suppose, Watson," said he, "that you imagine that I have added opium-smoking to cocaine
injections, and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical
views."

"I was certainly surprised to find you there."
