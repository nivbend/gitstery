One morning, at a little before seven o'clock, I was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to
announce that two men had come from Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. I dressed
hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs.
As I descended, my old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.

"I've got him here," he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder; "he's all right."

"What is it, then?" I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had
caged up in my room.

"It's a new patient," he whispered. "I thought I'd bring him round myself; then he couldn't slip
away. There he is, all safe and sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as
you." And off he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.
