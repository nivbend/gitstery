"She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter again."

"And your father? Did you tell him?"

"Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer
again. As he said, what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and
then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled
on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about money and never would look
at a shilling of mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives
me half-mad to think of it, and I can't sleep a wink at night." She pulled a little handkerchief out
of her muff and began to sob heavily into it.

"I shall glance into the case for you," said Holmes, rising, "and I have no doubt that we shall
reach some definite result. Let the weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind
dwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory, as he has
done from your life."

"Then you don't think I'll see him again?"

"I fear not."
