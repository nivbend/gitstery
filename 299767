We passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage, and found ourselves in front
of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described. Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse
bar. Then he tried the various keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came from within, and
at the silence Holmes' face clouded over.

"I trust that we are not too late," said he. "I think, Miss Hunter, that we had better go in without
you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in."

It was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength. Together we rushed into the
room. It was empty. There was no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful
of linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.

"There has been some villainy here," said Holmes; "this beauty has guessed Miss Hunter's intentions
and has carried his victim off."

"But how?"

"Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it." He swung himself up onto the roof. "Ah,
yes," he cried, "here's the end of a long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did it."
