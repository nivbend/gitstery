"'I would go,' said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak calmly; 'I would go. I should not
stay here. There is no good for you to do.'

"'But, madam,' said I, 'I have not yet done what I came for. I cannot possibly leave until I have
seen the machine.'

"'It is not worth your while to wait,' she went on. 'You can pass through the door; no one hinders.'
And then, seeing that I smiled and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a
step forward, with her hands wrung together. 'For the love of Heaven!' she whispered, 'get away from
here before it is too late!'
