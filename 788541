There was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured tapping of Sherlock
Holmes' finger-tips upon the edge of the table. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.

"Get out!" said he.

"What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!"

"No more words. Get out!"

And no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon the stairs, the bang of a door, and
the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street.
