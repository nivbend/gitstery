"He certainly needs a wash," remarked Holmes. "I had an idea that he might, and I took the liberty
of bringing the tools with me." He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my
astonishment, a very large bath-sponge.

"He! he! You are a funny one," chuckled the inspector.

"Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly, we will soon make him cut
a much more respectable figure."

"Well, I don't know why not," said the inspector. "He doesn't look a credit to the Bow Street cells,
does he?" He slipped his key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper
half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug,
moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner's face.
