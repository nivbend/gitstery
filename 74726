It was after five o'clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no time to be lonely, for within
an hour there arrived a confectioner's man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked with the
help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite
epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany. There were
a couple of brace of cold woodcock, a pheasant, a pâté de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and
cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my two visitors vanished away, like the genii
of the Arabian Nights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered
to this address.

Just before nine o'clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room. His features were gravely
set, but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his
conclusions.

"They have laid the supper, then," he said, rubbing his hands.

"You seem to expect company. They have laid for five."

"Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in," said he. "I am surprised that Lord St. Simon
has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs."

It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in, dangling his glasses more
vigorously than ever, and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.
