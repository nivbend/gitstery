"Precisely."

"Then you may entirely rely on me."

He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and
simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his
sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare

actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.

laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a
nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their
mouths.

simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would
be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of
his princess. Now the question is--Where are we to find the photograph?"
