"Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking a little pale lately. I think that
the change would do you good, and you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes' cases."

"I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one of them," I answered. "But
if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I have only half an hour."

My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and
ready traveller. My wants were few and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab
with my valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and down the
platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travelling-cloak and
close-fitting cloth cap.

"It is really very good of you to come, Watson," said he. "It makes a considerable difference to me,
having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else
biassed. If you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets."

We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which Holmes had brought with
him. Among these he rummaged and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we
were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the
rack.

"Have you heard anything of the case?" he asked.
