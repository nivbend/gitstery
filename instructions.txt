A murder had been committed in Git Town!

The detective, Kyle Pumbinner, said the crime scene report is on the `gtpd-archive` branch. He
doesn't really remember the report ID... But he knows it was the first report he submitted after his
son's ninth birthday (which was Saturday, July 20th), and it was the only report he submitted that
week.

When you find a suspect, you'd probably want to interview them. To do that, first find out their
address. To go to that street, look for the street's name in the repository (Hint: it's a tag). To
go to house number N on that street, go to the Nth ancestor. If you'd like to inspect the
perimeters, you can look into the commit's contents - it'll contain a hash that you can view with
certain git commands.

Think you found the culprit? Check your answer with the following command:

    echo "John Doe" | git hash-object --stdin | grep -iq -f /dev/stdin <(git show solution) && echo 'You found the murderer!' || echo 'No cigar, chief... Try again.'

Replace John Doe with the name of the suspect that you want to check.

For an extra challenge, try and solve the mystery without ever using `git checkout`.
