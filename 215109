While Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of events, we had been whirling
through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and
we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us. Just as he finished, however, we drove
through two scattered villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.

"We are on the outskirts of Lee," said my companion. "We have touched on three English counties in
our short drive, starting in Middlesex, passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent. See
that light among the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears
have already, I have little doubt, caught the clink of our horse's feet."

"But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?" I asked.

"Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here. Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put
two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my
friend and colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have no news of her husband. Here we are.
Whoa, there, whoa!"

We had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds. A stable-boy had run
out to the horse's head, and springing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive
which led to the house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the
opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her
neck and wrists. She stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the
door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with
eager eyes and parted lips, a standing question.

"Well?" she cried, "well?" And then, seeing that there were two of us, she gave a cry of hope which
sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.
