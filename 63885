There's no one answering the door. Obviously you won't break in because you don't have a warrant or
anything. But nothing's wrong with looking around the place...

You check around the house, there's no car. Not even a driveway. You do find a bike resting against
the fence. It's pretty close to the factory, so makes sense the suspect bikes to work.

Just to make sure, you ask some of the neighbors, they confirm that the suspect doesn't own a car.
One of them says he doesn't even have a license.

Another neighbor says he saw the suspect coming back from work on the day of the murder at about
5PM, they chatted for a bit before his sister picked him up to visit their parents. They live pretty
far away, so that places him away from Git Town at the time of the murder.
