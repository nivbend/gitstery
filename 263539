"I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would break her heart--it will break
her heart when she hears that I am arrested."

"It may not come to that," said Holmes.

"What?"

"I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here, and I
am acting in her interests. Young McCarthy must be got off, however."

"I am a dying man," said old Turner. "I have had diabetes for years. My doctor says it is a question
whether I shall live a month. Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a jail."

Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him.
"Just tell us the truth," he said. "I shall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson here
can witness it. Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young McCarthy. I
promise you that I shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed."
