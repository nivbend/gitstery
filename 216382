"What are you going to do, then?" I asked.

"To smoke," he answered. "It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that you won't speak to me for
fifty minutes." He curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like
nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of
some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding
myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind
and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.
