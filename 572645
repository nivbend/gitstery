Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-room at the Crown Inn.
They were on the upper floor, and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of
the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his
huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him. The boy had some slight
difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor's voice and
saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him. The trap drove on, and a few minutes
later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-
rooms.

"Do you know, Watson," said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness, "I have really some
scruples as to taking you to-night. There is a distinct element of danger."

"Can I be of assistance?"

"Your presence might be invaluable."

"Then I shall certainly come."
