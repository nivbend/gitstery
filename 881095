"And you did very wisely," said Holmes. "Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be
happy to look into it. From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues
hang from it than might at first sight appear."

"Grave enough!" said Mr. Jabez Wilson. "Why, I have lost four pound a week."

"As far as you are personally concerned," remarked Holmes, "I do not see that you have any grievance
against this extraordinary league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some £30, to
say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the
letter A. You have lost nothing by them."
