"Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and changed my clothes. It was a
delicate part which I had to play then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert
scandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter. I
went and saw him. At first, of course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every particular
that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man,
however, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he became a little more
reasonable. I told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held--£1000 apiece. That
brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. 'Why, dash it all!' said he, 'I've let them
go at six hundred for the three!' I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them, on
promising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I got
our stones at 1000 pounds apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all was right, and
eventually got to my bed about two o'clock, after what I may call a really hard day's work."

"A day which has saved England from a great public scandal," said the banker, rising. "Sir, I cannot
find words to thank you, but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your skill has
indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him
for the wrong which I have done him. As to what you tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my very heart.
Not even your skill can inform me where she is now."
