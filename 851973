"Whose house is it?"

"Dr. Becher's."

"Tell me," broke in the engineer, "is Dr. Becher a German, very thin, with a long, sharp nose?"

The station-master laughed heartily. "No, sir, Dr. Becher is an Englishman, and there isn't a man in
the parish who has a better-lined waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as
I understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good Berkshire beef would do him no
harm."

The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the
fire. The road topped a low hill, and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of
us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front three fire-engines were
vainly striving to keep the flames under.
