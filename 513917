"Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather of a brickish red. Her
jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her
dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck and
sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn't
observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in
a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way."

Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.
