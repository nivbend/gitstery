"If I may give an opinion," remarked the strange gentleman, "we've had just a little too much
secrecy over this business already. For my part, I should like all Europe and America to hear the
rights of it." He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.

"Then I'll tell our story right away," said the lady. "Frank here and I met in '84, in McQuire's
camp, near the Rockies, where pa was working a claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I;
but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had a claim that
petered out and came to nothing. The richer pa grew the poorer was Frank; so at last pa wouldn't
hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he took me away to 'Frisco. Frank wouldn't throw up
his hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without pa knowing anything about it. It
would only have made him mad to know, so we just fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he
would go and make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as pa. So then
I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he
lived. 'Why shouldn't we be married right away, then,' said he, 'and then I will feel sure of you;
and I won't claim to be your husband until I come back?' Well, we talked it over, and he had fixed
it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and
then Frank went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to pa.
