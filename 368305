With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor. Twice he struck at the chamber
door without any reply from within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the
cocked pistol in my hand.

It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half
open, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this
table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare
ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap
lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin was cocked
upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling. Round his
brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round
his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.

"The band! the speckled band!" whispered Holmes.

I took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to move, and there reared itself
from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.

"It is a swamp adder!" cried Holmes; "the deadliest snake in India. He has died within ten seconds
of being bitten. Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the
pit which he digs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we can then remove
Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened."

As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man's lap, and throwing the noose round the
reptile's neck he drew it from its horrid perch and, carrying it at arm's length, threw it into the
iron safe, which he closed upon it.
