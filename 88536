"Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand
stock, paying 4½ per cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the
interest."

"You interest me extremely," said Holmes. "And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year,
with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way.
I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about £60."

"I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand that as long as I live at home
I don't wish to be a burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while I am staying
with them. Of course, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter
and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It
brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day."
