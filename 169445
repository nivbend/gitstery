"Here we are!" said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room. "The fire looks very seasonable in
this weather. You look cold, Mr. Ryder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my slippers
before we settle this little matter of yours. Now, then! You want to know what became of those
geese?"

"Yes, sir."

"Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in which you were interested--white,
with a black bar across the tail."

Ryder quivered with emotion. "Oh, sir," he cried, "can you tell me where it went to?"

"It came here."
