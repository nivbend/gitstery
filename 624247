"I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached it. And let me say to you, first,
that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding between
Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now fled together."

"My Mary? Impossible!"

"It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither you nor your son knew the true
character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle. He is one of the most dangerous
men in England--a ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or
conscience. Your niece knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he had done to
a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart. The devil knows
best what he said, but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every
evening."

"I cannot, and I will not, believe it!" cried the banker with an ashen face.

"I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. Your niece, when you had, as she
thought, gone to your room, slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into
the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he stood there. She
told him of the coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will.
I have no doubt that she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all
other loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had hardly listened to his instructions
when she saw you coming downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of
the servants' escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was all perfectly true.
