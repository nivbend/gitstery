A few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still gesticulating, but with so fixed a look
of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. For a
while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has
been driven to the extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his
head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre
of the room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his
hand and chatted with him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.

"You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?" said he. "You are fatigued with your haste.
Pray wait until you have recovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little
problem which you may submit to me."
